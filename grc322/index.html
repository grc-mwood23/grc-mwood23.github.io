        <h1> Didot vs. Bodoni </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Didot</h3> 
             <p>Didot was designed by Firmin Didot in 1784, which is the start of the period in which the most popular Didot typefaces were created. In Paris, Firmin Didot originally casted the font as type while his brother used them in print. Firmin Didot was a French engraver and printer and many members of his family were also printers. He was also inspired by John Baskerville and wanted to look more like a manuscript rather than the script fonts which were popular at the time. Didot is considered the first Modern typeface and continues to heavily influence typography to this day. </p>
             
			 <h3>Bodoni</h3> 

             <p>Bodoni was designed by Giabattista Bodoni in 1798. Giabattista Bodoni was an Italian engraver, typographer, printer and publisher. He was inspired by John Baskerville, Pierre Simon, and Firmin Didot. He intended to create a font similar to others of the time period but wanted to stray away from the script fonts and create something more contemporary. Giabattista Bodoni was born in Italy and had designed multiple typefaces at the time yet only one is named after him. </p>
